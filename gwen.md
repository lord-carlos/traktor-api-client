# Gwen.md

This file was created as part of the Traktor API client project. The node-example provides a real-time display of Traktor Pro data including:

- 4 decks (A, B, C, D) with track information, BPM, and play status
- Master clock with BPM and active deck
- Mixer channels with level meters and on-air indicators
- Browser/playlist navigation information

The visualization uses:
- Node.js/Express server with WebSocket support
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Real-time updates via WebSockets

To use the visualization:
1. Start the server with `npm run visualizer` (in the node-example folder)
2. Open http://localhost:8081/ in your browser
3. Configure Traktor Pro to send data to http://localhost:8080

The visualization updates in real-time as data flows from Traktor Pro through the API client.
